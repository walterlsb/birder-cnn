# birder-cnn

A project based on the dog/cat breed classifier in the second lesson of the Fast.ai course [Practical Deep Learning for Coders, v3] (https://course.fast.ai/index.html).

The project uses the [North American Birds dataset] (http://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds)  published by The Corenell Lab of Ornithology which includes 48,000 photographs of 400 commonly observed species of North American birds including seperate classes for males, females and juveniles totally 700 categories.

The simple application of the Fast.ai library to the dataset returned an 85% accuracy measure in the validation set.

The birder-render application (https://github.com/walterlsb/birder-render) makes the model accessible from a web-browser.
